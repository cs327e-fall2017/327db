This is a star schema, as instructed in the Lab2 instructions.
We recognize that the dim_title table setup results in a database that
is only normalized to the 1NF (specifically, dim_title.start_year, end_year,
and title_type depend only on the title_id and not on the genre, but genre
must be part of the primary key as several title_ids are classified into 
multiple genres. A different database schema could be created by splitting
the dim_title form and normalizing to 3NF as discusse in class, but 
this would adhere less closely to the dimensional schema which was described
as required in the lab and also which was described in an article posted
by the instructor in Piazza.

Concisely, fact_title represents the fact table, dim_title represents
the only dimension table, while the other two tables are solely to supplement
analysis in the business case described in the Lab2 assignment.

Names and detailed explanations of tables are below:

1. fact_title: holds relevant but not essential attributes.
--Information serves as supplementary to those attributes that are to be queried on.
--Serves as fact table for this star schema.
--1:1 relationship with fact_title.title_id <-> title_episodes.title_id 
----explained under title_episodes table description.
--1:m relationship with fact_title.title_id <-> dim_title.title_id
----explained in dim_title table description.

2. title_episodes: for supplemental business case use.
--Provides information for further analysis (i.e. series information)
if query results only yield episode information.
--1:1 relationship with fact_title.title_id <-> title_episodes.title_id
----allows analyst to look up parent title from episode title query results
--1:m relationship with fact_title.title_id <-> title_episodes.parent_title_id
----To map back to supplementary information in fact_title table

3. dim_title: contains essential attributes.
--Contains all attributes which management has demonstrated interest in analyzing
--Serves as dimensional table for this star schema.
--m:1 relationship with dim_title.title_id <-> fact_title.title_id
----If title_id is classified into multiple genres, there will be 
----multiple rows with the same title_id
--m:1 relationship with dim_title.average_rating <-> rating_class.average_rating
----explained under rating_class description.

4. rating_class: classifies numeric rating into management categorical terms
--1:m relationship with rating_class.average_rating <-> dim_title.average_rating
----Allows analyst to lookup and sort by categorical management term.
